        "This  means that any comments or text answers in your file should be in SQL comments or in markdown cells. Answers in the comments section of assignment submissions on CANVAS are not acceptable and will not be read.\n",

        "\n",
        "You may use the search engine of your choice to look up the syntax for SQL commands or PostgreSQL imperative SQL syntax, but may not use it to find answers. Be sure to include the urls of any sites you reviewed as comments in your code.\n",
